DWSH
by JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver and Neeraj Bhatia

Features:
	Forks and executes commands!
	Parses multiple commands on one line!
	Redirects using >, <!
	Guaranteed to regrow hair!
	Can summon a winged unicorn for fast & magical transit!

Attempted:
	The following did not end up working, but have been left
		in the code, commented out.
	Could not get pipes to work
	Tried to implement >>, but it kept overwriting the file
	Looked at replacing ~/ with home directory, got seg faults
	Was unable to have the "puppy" command produce a puppy and
		eject it from the optical drive.

Bugs:
	Putting two ;'s next to each other will break the parser
	Redirecting to a file that does not exist occasionally
		does not work.
	Hair regrowth function may result in a seg fault.
	Occasionally, the unicorn command will fail, opening a
		great chasm in the earth and summoning the demon 
		Beelzebub, who will proceeded to unleash his wrath 
		and begin his reign of terror.

	Handles all line parsing fucntions
	/*======== int count_tokens() ==========
	Inputs:  char *line
        	  char delim 
	Returns: Number of tokens in line separated by delim

	Counts the number of times the character delim appears in the
	 string line
	The number of tokens is 1 more than the number of appearences 
	of delim
	If delim does not appear, 1 is returned
	====================*/

	/*======== char ** parse_line() ==========
	Inputs:  char *line 
	Returns: Array of strings where each entry is a token 
	separated by delim

	If line contains multiple tokens separated by delim, this 
	function will put each token into an array of strings
	====================*/

	/*======== char * trim() ==========
	Inputs:  char *line 
	Returns: Pointer to the beginning of line

	Removes leading and trailing whitespace on the string line.
